    This tool calculates how the "Rate" knob found on the LFOs and global LFOs affects
    the frequency/duration<sup><a href="#foot-1">[1]</a></sup> of the LFO cycles in
    U-HE's magnificent <a href="http://www.u-he.com/cms/zebra">Zebra</a> software synthesizer.
    The idea came to me when I read <a href="http://www.kvraudio.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=318470">
        this thread at kvraudio.com</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Note: the Rate knob scales the speed of the LFO relative to the value set for the
    "Sync" parameter. E.g. if you set the "Sync" value to 10s (10 seconds), a Rate value
    of 100 - the neutral setting - means that one cycle of the LFO takes 10 seconds.
    A Rate value of 200 (the maximum, which is a speed scaling factor of 8.0) will cause
    the LFO to run 8 times faster (that is, each cycle takes only 1.25 seconds). A Rate
    value of 50 corresponds to a speed scaling factor of 0.125, ie. each cycles takes
    eight times as long (80 seconds).</p>
<p>
    Basically, this tool answers three questions:</p>
<dl>
    <dt>What is the speed/duration scaling factor for a given knob value?</dt>
    <dd>
        Use the slider on the left hand side to set the knob value or enter the value directly
        in the text box next to "Knob value". The text boxes on the left now show how much
        the speed and the duration of the cycle respectively affect the base value (the
        "Sync" parameter).
        <br />
        <strong>Example</strong>: you want to know what the speed/duration scaling factor
        is for the knob value "150". Set the knob value to "150". The "Speed scaling factor"
        value is 3.375, that is, the frequency is actually 3.375 times faster than the "Sync"
        value. Likewise, the duration of one LFO cycle is scaled by 0.296, ie. each LFO
        cycle takes only 29.6% of the time of the base value.</dd>
    <dt>Whats is the knob value for a given speed relative to the base value?</dt>
    <dd>
        Use the slider on the right side to set the "Speed scaling factor" value or enter
        the value directly in the corresponding text box. The "Knob value" text box on the
        left hand side now shows the value you need the "Rate" knob to.
        <br />
        <strong>Example</strong>: you want the LFO to go 50% faster than the "Sync" value.
        Set "Speed scaling factor" to 1.5 (1.5 times faster than sync value). The "Knob
        value" shows 114.471, so set the Rate knob to 114.47 to achieve a (roughly) 50%
        speed up.</dd>
    <dt>Whats is the knob value for a given duration relative to the base value?</dt>
    <dd>
        Use the slider on the right side to set the "Duration scaling factor" value or enter
        the value directly in the corresponding text box. The "Knob value" text box on the
        left hand side now shows the value you need to set the "Rate" knob to.
        <br />
        <strong>Example</strong>: you want the LFO to take 3/4 of the time of the sync value.
        Set "Duration scaling factor" to 0.75. The "Knob value" shows 110.064, so set the
        Rate knob to 110.064 to make one LFO cycle last roughly 3/4 of the time of the base
        value.</dd>
</dl>
<h2>
    The formula</h2>
<p>
    The relationship between the knob value and the actual speed scaling factor is as
    follows:</p>
<p>
    <code>SpeedScale = (KnobValue/100) ^ 3 </code><em>(ie. the cube of a hundredth of the
        knob value)</em></p>
<p>
    -- or respectively --</p>
<p>
    <code>KnobValue = 100 * SpeedScale ^ (1/3) </code><em>(ie. 100 times the cube root of
        the speed scaling factor)</em></p>
<p>
    Where <code>KnobValue</code> is the value of the Rate knob and <code>SpeedScale</code>
    is the scaling factor of the LFO frequency.</p>
<p>
    NB: <code>SpeedScale</code> can be replaced by <code>(1/DurationScale)</code> (where
    <code>DurationScale</code> is the duration scaling factor applied to the duration
    of the cycles of the LFO) if necessary.</p>

        <sup>[1]</sup> We use the term "speed" for an LFO's frequency (cycles per second)
        and the term "duration" for its period (duration of one cycle) in this text. Frequency
        and period of a wave are closely related. The frequency is the inverse of the period
        (and vice versa): if the frequency is F, the period is 1/F.
